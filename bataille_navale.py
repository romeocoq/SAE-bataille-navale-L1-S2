# We encode the knowledge a player has from the game in a dictionary `player` as follows:
# - player["grid"] encodes the grid the player is playing with
# - player["history"] encodes the history of moves player by the player
# - player["boat"] keeps track of the damages on each boat of the player
# - player["nboat"] keeps track of the number of undestroyed boats on the board
# 
# Each boat is represented by one letter :
#
# - the carrier (size 5) is denoted with letter C
# - the battle ship (size 4) is denoted with letter B
# - the destroyer (size 3) is denoted with letter D
# - the submarine (size 3) is denoted with letter S
# - the patrol boat (size 2) is denoted with letter P

# More details now:
# - player["grid"] is a 10x10 string list such that player["grid"][i][j] is:
#   - "." if the cell (i,j) is empty
#   - "x" if the cell contains a boat that has been hit by the other player
#   - "C" (resp "N","D","S","P") if the carrier is at position (i,j) and has not yet been hit. 
# - player["history"] is a 10x10 string list such that player["history"][i][j] is:
#   - "?" if the player has not yet shot at position (i,j)
#   - "M" if the player has shot at position (i,j) and missed
#   - "H" if the player has shot at position (i,j) and hit
# - player["boat"] is a dictionary such that player["boat"][L] is the number of cells not hit for the boat denoted by letter L. For example, at start, player["boat"]["C"] is 5 because the carrier is unhit and has size 5. If the other player hits the carrier once, then player["boat"]["C"] is decreased to 4.

# Here are some general values for the game

boatSizes = {"C":5, "B":4, "D":3, "S":3, "P":2}
gridsize  = 10

# We now give functions to update and built player's datastructures:
